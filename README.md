In this project I learned how to launch and implement an EC2 instance using AWS and VSCode.
VSCode was used to set up a remote SSH connection to the virtual server where I installed Apache Maven and Java to generate a basic web app structure.
My main highlight was integrating VSCode and EC2 to set up an IDE for a virtual machine.
The documented report has a more indepth process.
